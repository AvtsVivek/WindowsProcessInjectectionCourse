    Note the user name, or the account under which these svc host services run. The SYSTEM account is the most power ful account, so any hacker injecting into these process, can do practially anything. That should be born in mind.

16. So if a process creates another process, then the first process is parent of the second. But note that, does not mean there is a dependencies between parent and child. The child can continue to live with the parent, that is, if the parent is terminated, the child will continue to live. The life time is completely independent.
