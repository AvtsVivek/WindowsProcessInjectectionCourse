# C# CSharp Process Injection

Demonstrate Memory Allocation and Thread Creation Without Shellcode

This example demonstrates how to allocate memory in the current process using `VirtualAlloc` and create a new thread using `CreateThread`. It does not include shellcode injection but serves as a foundational example for understanding process injection techniques.

This is based on the suggestion given by github copilot.
